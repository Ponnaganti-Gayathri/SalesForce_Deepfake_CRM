# 🧠 Deepfake CRM – Intelligent Salesforce Integration
A multi-phase Salesforce CRM project for detecting, analyzing, and managing deepfake video incidents.
________________________________________
# 📌 Overview
Deepfake CRM is a Salesforce implementation that demonstrates how to design a centralized CRM system for managing deepfake video detection workflows end-to-end.
It leverages Salesforce core features, automation, Apex, Lightning components, and integration-ready architecture.
The solution maps the real-world threat of hyper-realistic synthetic media (deepfakes) into a structured Salesforce ecosystem suited for:
-	Media & news organizations
-	Government & regulatory agencies
-	Social media platforms
-	Enterprises handling fraud/misinformation
-	Public reporting channels

# ✨ Key Features
🔍 Deepfake Case Lifecycle
-	Users upload videos.
-	Detection triggered via external AI (Einstein or ML APIs).
-	Generates confidence score + forensic details.
-	Automatically creates Salesforce Cases, Alerts, and Notifications.

# ⚙️ Admin Configuration & Automation
-	Custom objects: Video, Alert
-	Validation rules for strong data quality
-	Workflow Rules + Email Alerts
-	Custom Notifications for system & incident updates

# 🧩 Apex-Driven Business Logic
Includes:
-	Apex Classes & Trigger Handler Patterns
-	SOQL/SOSL queries & Collections
-	Batch Apex, Future, Queueable, Scheduled Apex
-	Exception handling & Logging

Even though integrations are conceptual in this phase, the design supports:
-	Named Credentials
-	External Services
-	REST/SOAP Callouts
-	Platform Events & CDC
-	Salesforce Connect
-	OAuth & Security Best Practices
