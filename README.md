🧠 Deepfake CRM – Intelligent Salesforce Integration
A multi-phase Salesforce CRM project for detecting, analyzing, and managing deepfake video incidents.
________________________________________
📌 Overview
Deepfake CRM is a Salesforce implementation that demonstrates how to design a centralized CRM system for managing deepfake video detection workflows end-to-end.
It leverages Salesforce core features, automation, Apex, Lightning components, and integration-ready architecture.
The solution maps the real-world threat of hyper-realistic synthetic media (deepfakes) into a structured Salesforce ecosystem suited for:
•	Media & news organizations
•	Government & regulatory agencies
•	Social media platforms
•	Enterprises handling fraud/misinformation
•	Public reporting channels

✨ Key Features
🔍 Deepfake Case Lifecycle
•	Users upload videos.
•	Detection triggered via external AI (Einstein or ML APIs).
•	Generates confidence score + forensic details.
•	Automatically creates Salesforce Cases, Alerts, and Notifications.
